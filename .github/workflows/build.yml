      # The names of the artifacts containing native libraries correspond
      # exactly to the directories inside `src/main/c/resources/native`. That
      # way, the Java build job can pull down all artifacts and unpack them
      # into that directory to overwrite the versions in-repo. This is sadly
      # necessary because the actions/download-artifact@v3 action flattens
      # paths inside artifacts. If it retained full relative paths, we could
      # put Linux and Windows natives inside the same artifact, and we could be
      # flexible with the artifact names. But it doesn't, so we can't, and we
      # can't.
