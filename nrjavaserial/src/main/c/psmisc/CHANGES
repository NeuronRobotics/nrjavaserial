Changes from maintained version 18 (30-AUG-1998)
=============================
 - This is not the maintained version.  It would be nice to merge this
   into the maintained version but its too much of a hack.
 - _hacks_ to get a lib Trent Jarvi taj@www.linux.org.uk
 - basically chopped main out of fuser.c and exported foo()'s requried
   to get a string back showing who had a fd opened.

Changes from version 17 to 18 (1-NOV-1998)
=============================

 - fuser: usage summary listed -s (silent) as -q
 - fuser: fuser x/y yielded confusing error message if x/y doesn't exist
   (reported by Tigran Aivazian)
 - fuser: new option -i for interactive killing (like killall -i)
 - killall: tried to print a NULL pointer if full process name was unavailable
   and killing failed
 - killall: new option -g to kill process group instead of process
 - killall: cosmetic PROC_BASE changes (by Florian La Roche)
 - pidof: new option -g to show PGID instead of PID (by Florian La Roche)
 - pstree: new option -H to highlight process specified by PID
 - added -D_GNU_SOURCE to CFLAGS for glibc 2 compatibility
 - Makefile should now also work with bash-2


Changes from version 16 to 17 (17-FEB-1998)
=============================

 - fuser: now also handles /proc of recent 2.1 kernels (fix by Andreas Schwab;
   other fixed also proposed by Chris Wedgwood and Luca Berra)
 - pstree now properly handles init with PID = PPID = 1
 - fuser: no longer changes the name space for relative paths ending with the
   name of a name space (e.g. something/tcp)

 - killall: didn't handle malloc failure


Changes from version 15 to 16 (28-JUL-1997)
=============================

 - killall: now gets the list of all PIDs before killing processes, thereby
   avoiding race between readdir and /proc (found by Boris Zentner)
 - make install no longer changes BINDIR and MANDIR if they already exist
 - changed psmisc.<version>.lsm to psmisc-<version>.lsm for consistency


Changes from version 14 to 15 (16-JUN-1997)
=============================

 - killall: killall -v didn't print the command name (fixed by Marty Leisner)
 - fuser: fuser -a <unix_domain_socket>  could crash (reported by Helmut Geyer)
 - fuser: fuser -m didn't consider UNIX domain sockets (fix based on a patch by
   Andries Brouwer)
 - fuser: fuser -a /a /a /b  no longer merges the first two entries
 - changed package name format from psmisc.<version> to psmisc-<version> to
   avoid annoyance messages from sunsite's archive scripts


Changes from version 13 to 14 (19-APR-1997)
=============================

 - killall: command-line parser didn't accept -signal (fixed by Chris Wedgwood)
 - pidof: minor man page correction

 - fuser: INET domain sockets can now be specified as
   [local_port][,[remote_host][,[remote_port]]]

   compilation with some ancient kernels.
 - killall: new option -q to suppress error message if no process was found
 - killall: man page didn't reset font properly
 - killall: now tries harder to handle very long names (> 15 characters)
   (proposed by Erik Thiele)
 - killall: new option -e to require exact name match
 - killall: now lists PIDs if invoked as "pidof" (proposed by Peter Daum)

=============================

 - fuser is now able to look up INET and UNIX domain sockets

Changes from version 10 to 11 (20-SEP-1995)

 - size of command name is now defined in comm.h - the old approach of
   obtaining values from linux/sched.h:struct task_struct doesn't work anymore)

===========================

   reported by Harald Koenig, Nick Simicich, and others)
 - fuser: now also scans /proc/*/maps
 - fuser: fixed NULL pointer dereferencing when processes are created while
   fuser is running (fix by Pauline Middelink)

   no process entries (i.e. if it is not mounted)
 - killall: more detailed usage output

 - fuser and killall: fixed generation of signal list to include SIGUSR[12]

 - man pages: minor corrections and improvements

Changes from version 6 to 7

 - fuser: added non-zero return code if no processes using any file are
	  found.
 - pstree and fuser: non-printable characters in command names (fuser: also
     in file names) are now shown as \nnn (octal). \ is shown as \\.
