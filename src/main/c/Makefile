# Native library compilation.
#
# The suggested package names assume you're running Debian 10 (buster) or a
# close relative (e.g., Ubuntu) on an amd64 build host.
#
# For each supported platform, this file defines which objects need to be
# built, how the resulting library binary should be organized in the source
# tree, and compiler and linker executables and flags. Due to the mind-boggling
# complexity of writing interesting dynamic Make rules, the actual build is
# delegated to a sub-Make task.
#
# To define compilation for a new platform, the following target-specific
# variables must be exported:
#
# * platform: The subdirectory within `resources/native/` which will hold the
#             library binary.
# * variant: A suffix inserted into the filename of the library between its
#            regular name and its extension. E.g., if the usual name of the
#            library is “libNRJavaSerial.so”, for variant “foo”, the filename
#            produced will be “libNRJavaSerialfoo.so”. This is useful for ARM
#            platforms, where there are multiple variants on the same core
#            32-bit architecture.
# * lib_type: The type of library (so, dylib, dll). Used to construct the
#             library filename.
#
# Additionally, the following variables will already have sensible definitions
# for compilation targetting the build host, but some of which will probably
# require overriding for cross-compilation:
#
# * CC and LD: Command names for the compiler and linker, respectively.
# * CFLAGS and LDFLAGS: Flags for the compiler and linker, respectively.
# * objects: The names of the object files to be compiled and linked together
#            to form the library. A 1-to-1 relationship between object names
#            (`foo.o`) and source file names (`foo.c`) is assumed. Most
#            platforms build from the same source set, but sometimes additional
#            code is necessary (e.g., on Windows).
#
# Your target must also invoke the `natives.mk` sub-makefile directly.
# Unfortunately, this must be done per-target: it cannot be done as a phony
# rule, because Make will invoke each target at most once per run. If you split
# the invocation into such a rule:
#
# .PHONY: natives
# natives:
# 	$(MAKE) -f natives.mk
#
# ...it will only be invoked for the first target which depends on it.
#
# See the existing targets for examples of all of this. The Windows and macOS
# targets are good examples, because they require overrides for just about
# everything.

# We need to know the location of a Java installation to include the JNI
# headers. We'd rather pull from the JAVA_HOME environment variable, but it's
# very often not set. In cases where it's absent, this included Makefile will
# attempt to discover the Java home path.
include JAVA_HOME.mk

include platform.mk

# Most of the time, GCC is called `gcc` and is installed from a `gcc` package.
# However, sometimes a distribution packages multiple versions of GCC. In this
# case, both the binary and package names of non-default versions are suffixed
# (e.g., `gcc-8`). We can't use the standard CC variable to adapt to this,
# because each target already overrides that variable with the name of the
# appropriate cross compiler.
GCC ?= gcc

# In all cases, we want to include the system JNI headers, our own headers,
# crank the optimization level, and compile position-independent code so that
# it will work as a library (dlopen(3) et al. can load it into any memory).
export CFLAGS ?= -I"$(JAVA_HOME)/include" -I./include -I./include/target \
                   -O3 -fPIC -c \
                   -Wall
# We want to use the compiler frontend to invoke the linker, too.
export LD = $(CC)
# We want to link objects into a shared library.
export LDFLAGS ?= -fPIC -shared

define NO_TARGET_PLATFORM_SPECIFIED
You must specify a target platform to build its natives:

    make linux|osx|freebsd|windows

The “linux” target encompasses both x86 and ARM platforms. To install
cross-compilation toolchains to target these platforms and Windows from an
amd64 build host running Debian or a derivative, build the “crosstools” target
as root
